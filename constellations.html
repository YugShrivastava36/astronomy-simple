                Constellations are patterns of stars, which are visible clearly in the night sky, as they are noticable. They often resemble  animals, humans, or objects. These patterns were named and given stories by different cultures, serving both as myths and as guides for navigation. For example, Orion is seen as a hunter, while Ursa Major is recognized as the Great Bear. In modern astronomy, constellations are used to divide the sky into regions, making it easier to locate stars and celestial objects. Altogether, there are 88 officially recognized constellations that cover the entire sky, acting like a giant map above us.
                <br><br>
                 People in ancient times used constellations to tell seasons, guide farming, and help sailors travel at night. Today, astronomers use them like a sky map to locate stars, planets, and galaxies. Each constellation marks a section of the sky, so when scientists say something is “in Orion” or “in Leo,” they mean it is found in that part of the sky.
                 <br><br>
                Constellations are also fun for stargazing. If you go outside at night and look up, spotting a constellation can make the sky feel less random and more like a giant puzzle of star pictures.
