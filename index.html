      <h2 text-align: center;>Some facts!</h2>
      <br>
      Have you ever wondered how astronomers or scientists calculate distances between celestial bodies?<br>
      We use kilometers or miles to measure distances here on earth, but they (astronomers and scientists) use different units of measurements!<br><br>

      The most widely used unit of measurement is <i>light years</i>. It's the distance of how much light has travelled in 1 earth year (or just 365 days)<br>
      The speed of light is 3 x 10^8 m/sec (300,000 meters per second). Wow, thats incredibly fast! Light from the Moon to reach Earth takes ~1 sec!<br><br>

      distance of Moon from the Earth= 340,400 km <br>
      speed of light = 300,000 km/sec <br>
      
      Time= 340,000km/300,000 = ~1.13 sec
      <br><br>
      Wow, Math is OP!

      <br><br>
      Neutron stars are so dense that a single teaspoon of their material would weigh about 6 billion tons!<br>
      Jupiter’s moon Ganymede is bigger than Mercury — it’s the largest moon in the solar system.<br>
      Saturn’s rings are only about 10 meters thick, but they span over 280,000 km wide!
      The Sun makes up 99.86% of the mass of our entire solar system.<br>
      A day on Mercury lasts 59 Earth days — but its year is only 88 Earth days.<br>
      There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth.<br>
      Black holes can slow down time — the closer you get, the slower time moves for you.<br><br>

      The universe is a vast and mysterious place, filled with wonders that stretch the limits of imagination. Black holes, for example, are regions of space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape — and they can form from the collapse of massive stars. Some stars live for billions of years, while others explode in spectacular supernovae, scattering elements that eventually form new stars and planets. Our own solar system is just one of billions in the Milky Way galaxy, which itself is just one of countless galaxies in the universe. Every time we look up at the night sky, we’re peering into the past, seeing light that has traveled for millions or even billions of years to reach us.
