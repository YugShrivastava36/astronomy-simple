                To understand neutron stars, we must understand super massive star's death.<br>
                A supermassive star ends its life in a dramatic way. When it runs out of fuel, its core can no longer support the crushing weight of its outer layers. The core collapses in an instant, triggering a powerful explosion called a supernova that blasts material into space. If the star was extremely massive, the collapse continues until it forms a black hole, an object with gravity so strong that not even light can escape, OR, there is also another option, which is a <i>Neutron Star</i>.<br><br>


                A neutron star is a dead remain of the star from it originated. It's core (the innermost layer) is so tightly packed that even proton (light) and electrons are merged together!<br>
                <div id="facts"></div>
                It's so heavy that a teaspoon of it would weigh more than the the <i>MOUNT EVEREST</i>.<br>
                Neutron star can have a radius of about 10km and a mass of 1.4 Solar masses! Wow thats massive! <br> It is suspected that there are about 1 billion neutron stars just in <i>our</i> galaxy, the Milky Way.<br><br>

                However, many of them have existed for a long period of time and have cooled down considerably. These stars radiate very little electromagnetic radiation; most neutron stars that have been detected occur only in certain situations in which they do radiate, such as if they are a pulsar or a part of a binary system. Slow-rotating and non-accreting neutron stars are difficult to detect, due to the absence of electromagnetic radiation; however, since the Hubble Space Telescope's detection of RX J1856.5−3754 in the 1990s, a few nearby neutron stars that appear to emit only thermal radiation have been detected.<br><br>

                Hence, we can say that the Universe can push things to its absoloute limits! In short we can say that neutron stars is a very dense, dead core of a star which spins very fast, here's a fact! Because you know, who doesn't like facts?<br>
                
                A teaspoon of a neutron star would weigh more than the Mount Everest!
