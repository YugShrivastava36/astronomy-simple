                    A planet is a large, celestial body which is round in shape and it orbits around a star.<br>
                    These are basic set of conditions in which a celestial body needs to follow in-order to be a planet.

                    <h3><b><u>Types of planets:</u></b></h3>
                    1. Rocky planets<br>
                    These are made of solid rock and metal. They are smaller and closer to the Sun.<br>
                    Examples: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars<br><br>
                    2. Gas giants
                    These are much larger and made mostly of gases like hydrogen and helium.<br>
                    Examples: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.<br>
                    Other than these, there are more types which are used by scientists and astronmers to classify the categories of planets and to better understand them.<br><br>
                    3.Ice Giants<br><br>
                    - Similar to gas giants but with more icy materials like water and methane<br>
                    - Examples: Uranus, Neptune<br><br>
                    4. Dwarf Planets<br><br>
                    - Small, round objects that orbit the Sun but haven’t cleared their path of other space stuff<br>
                    - Examples: Pluto, Ceres, Eris<br><br>
                    5. Rogue Planets<br><br>
                    - Planets that don’t orbit any star — they float alone in space<br>
                    - They may have been kicked out of their solar system<br><br>
                    6. Exoplanets<br><br>
                    - Planets outside our solar system<br>
                    - Thousands have been found around other stars<br><br>
                    7. Super-Earths and Mega-Earths<br><br>
                    - Bigger than Earth but smaller than gas giants<br>
                    - May be rocky or have thick atmospheres<br><br>

                    8. Hot Jupiters<br><br>
                    - Gas giants that orbit very close to their star<br>
                    - Extremely hot and fast-moving<br><br>

                    These types help scientists understand how planets form and behave in different parts of the universe. Let me know if you want to turn this into a webpage section or add visuals for each type.

                    <h3><u><b>How planets move:</b></u></h3>
                    - Planets orbit (go around) a star.<br>
                    - They also spin on their own axis, which causes day and night.<br><br>

                    <h3><b><u>Interesting facts:</u></b></h3>
                    - Earth is the only planet known to support life.<br>
                    - Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system.<br>
                    - Venus is the hottest planet, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.<br>
                    - Uranus spins on its side, unlike the other planets.<br><br>
