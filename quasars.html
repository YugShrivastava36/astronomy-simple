                            Quasars are among the most mysterious and powerful objects in the universe. In simple terms, a quasar is a supermassive black hole sitting at the center of a galaxy. When huge amounts of gas and dust fall into this black hole, they spin around it at incredible speeds, heat up, and release enormous amounts of energy. This energy is so strong that a single quasar can shine brighter than all the stars in its galaxy combined.
                            <br><br>
                            Quasars are very far away, which means we see them as they were billions of years ago. Because of this, they act like “time machines,” giving scientists clues about how galaxies and black holes grew in the early universe. Even though they are powered by black holes, quasars don’t look dark at all—they look like dazzling beacons that can be seen across the cosmos.

                            <br><br>
                            In short, quasars are distant, super-bright objects created by hungry black holes, and they help us understand both the past and the extreme limits of the universe.
