                Star clusters are very large, areas (spaces) in space which contain large amounts of stars!<br>
                Now you might be wondering, how are they in one place? Now the answer is quite, simple, you see the gravitational force (a force which pulls objects towards every object) keeps the stars pullin to various other stars, making them stable.<br><br>

                Now they are 2 types of star clusters, one is the Globular cluster, and other one is the open star cluster.<br>
                    <div id="Globular Clusters"></div>
                <b><u>Globular Clusters:</u></b> These are a type of star clusters in which thousands of millions of stars are present very near!
                <br>
                    <div id="Open Clusters"></div>
                <b><u>Open clusters:</u></b> These are a type of star clusters in which less number of stars are present at quite a distance!<br><br>
                    
                    As they move through their galaxy, over time, open clusters become disrupted by the gravitational influence of giant molecular clouds, so that the clusters observed are often young. Even though no longer gravitationally bound, they will continue to move in broadly the same direction through space and are then known as stellar associations, sometimes referred to as moving groups. Globular clusters, with more members and more mass, remain intact for far longer and the globular clusters observed are usually billions of years old.

                    Star clusters within the Milky Way that are visible to the naked eye, include the Pleiades and Hyades open clusters, and the globular cluster 47 Tucanae.<br><br>

                    Star clusters are born when a huge cloud of gas and dust in space gets pulled together by gravity. As the cloud squeezes in, it breaks into smaller lumps, and each lump turns into a star. Since all the stars are made from the same cloud at almost the same time, they stay close together like a group of friends in the sky.<br><br>
